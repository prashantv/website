About Me - Prashant V
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I'm a Computer Science graduate with first class honours from the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au">Computer Science and Engineering</a> faculty at the <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au">University of New South Wales</a>.
<p>
My major interest throughout university has been operating systems, and my <a href="http://www.disy.cse.unsw.edu.au/theses_public/10/prashantv.pdf">honours thesis</a> was on building possibly the first hypervisor for ARM that can virtualize unmodified guest operating systems.
